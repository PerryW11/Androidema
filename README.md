# Androidema (Work in progress)

You have been programmed to serve your people. Your specialty is combat and destruction.

Your creators want the one thing that keeps this vast galaxy thriving, and that is rodon.

Rodon is a precious resource that brings longevity and life, inciting new behaviors to the DNA (or circuitry) of a being.

This incites a burst of evolutionary traits. Without it, your kind is considered of lesser stature.

Rodon is needed, as life on your planet shall slowly decend into a whirlpool of chaos and greed in its absence.

Do what is necessary to ensure the extraction of this precious material.
